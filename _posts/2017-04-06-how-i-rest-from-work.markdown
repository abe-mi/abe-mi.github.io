I was born in the beautiful but not so interesting town of Allegan, Michigan. I grew up there, living in the same home my entire life until I departed for college at 18. I attended Allegan High school, where I was a member of the National Honor Society and played on the varsity football team, a team in which I was nominated team captain for my junior and senior seasons along with earning All-conference and All-state honors during that span. After graduating, I went on to attend Michigan State University, where I earned a degree in Communication Science, Analytics and Research Methods. Now that may sound like a mouthful, but it is a degree that has served me well in my career by offering me advanced knowledge in research techniques and data analysis skills. I was fortunate enough to land a job at a local automotive dealer after college as a marketing coordinator, a position that allowed me to spearhead the creation of an in-house marketing department that actively studied and strategized different approaches for generating sales. I have been able to apply my data entry and analysis knowledge in a practical setting to analyze data and create valuable reports on performance of marketing/advertising strategies that I personally put in place. I have worked on various projects, ranging from automotive appraisals to social media campaigns to market research studies. Projects that have yielded positive results for the company with an increase in monthly sales of. (insert percentage here)
