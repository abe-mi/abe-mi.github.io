I was born in the beautiful but not so interesting town of Allegan, Michigan. I grew up there, living in the same home my entire life until I departed for college at 18. I attended Allegan High school, where I was a member of the National Honor Society and played on the varsity football team, a team in which I was nominated team captain for my junior and senior seasons along with earning All-conference and All-state honors during that span. After graduating, I went on to attend Michigan State University, where I earned a degree in Communication Science, Analytics and Research Methods. Now that may sound like a mouthful, but it is a degree that has served me well in the early stages of my career, offering me advanced knowledge in research techniques and data analysis skills. 

I was fortunate enough to land an amazing position at Tapper automotive after college as their marketing director, a position that allowed me to spearhead the creation of an in-house marketing department that actively studied and strategized different approaches for generating sales. I have been able to apply my data entry and analysis knowledge in a practical setting to analyze data and create valuable reports on performance of marketing/advertising strategies that I personally put in place. I have worked on various projects, ranging from automotive appraisals to social media campaigns to market research studies. Projects that have yielded positive results for the company with an increase in monthly sales of. (insert percentage here)

## Hobbies and Interests 
When I’m not crunching numbers or deep in a spreadsheet, you’ll probably find me trying to fix my golf swing, emphasis on *trying*. I’m a firm believer that playlists are the modern mixtape, and curating them with my girlfriend Emily has become a borderline competitive art form. Whether it’s a laid-back Sunday night watching MCDC make an outrageous 4th down decision that somehow always works or a Tigers day game that turns into a whole event, I’m always up for sports and a drink in good company.

 I am absolutely a glass-half-full person, and for me, that hinges on starting or ending my day at the gym. I watch way too many movies that make you rethink everything-or at least argue about the ending. My dog Hilo keeps me grounded and *moderately* active, while weekends at the lake with a glass of whisky and some dad-level wisdom hit reset better than any app ever could. When I’m not doing all that, I’m probably dreaming up the next travel plan I swear I’ll actually book this time.
